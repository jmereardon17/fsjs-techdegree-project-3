# FSJS Techdegree Project 3

For this project I had use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference. Using the supplied HTML and CSS, I added my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

- Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
- Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields

I also went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to:

- Prevent users from registering for conflicting activities
- Add real-time error message (added to all required fields)
- Add Conditional error message (added to the Email field)

Grade: Exceeds Expectations
