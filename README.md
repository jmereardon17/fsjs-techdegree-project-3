# Interactive Form

An interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference. HTML and CSS supplied, I added my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

- Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
- Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields
